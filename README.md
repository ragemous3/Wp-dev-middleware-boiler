<h1>Wepback dev-middleware boiler</h1>

<p>Since I just extracted to code from another project I've worked on. It's not really
a boilerplate.. Yet. </p>
<br>
<p>Current Issues</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lots of packages(?) like react and so on. RESTORE ORDER!</li>
    <li>Workbox and webpack-helpers has been commented out</li>
    <li>The server code is a bit confusing I suppose</li>
    <li>Imagemin does not work on Unix-based systems</li>
    <li>Server is not programmed to send back minified images</li>
    <li>Server is only programmed to send back a gzip of the main modern-js-file</li>
  </ul>

<p>Feel free to contribute</p>
